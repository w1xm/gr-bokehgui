This is the GNU Radio BOKEHGUI module. It allows all the outputs and widgets
to work over the network. Basically it streams the data to frontend and a
frontend plotting library `Bokeh` plots the data. The widget callbacks are
handled by `Bokeh` and corresponding callback functions are defined in each
sinks.
